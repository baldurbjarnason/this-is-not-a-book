In this episode we cover a schism in digital media that traditional publishing has unwittingly played into.

* Baldur explains what it is that makes people the most angry at him.
* Moonshots versus Infrastructure.
* Digital media Reaganomics
* Brute force effort versus building automation
* Baldur agrees with a Nazi ([von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun)).
* Changes require infrastructure. Trickle-down economics don't build roads.
* Without open source and open standards we'd still be stuck in the CD-ROM model.
* Paradigm clashes are messy.
* [Touchpress](http://www.touchpress.com). [Editions at Play](https://editionsatplay.withgoogle.com/#/). Creative people doing clever things.
* Reviewing the story, not the innovation.
* On not releasing the APIs. Preventing people from copying or building on Edition at Play.
* The danger of building one-off infrastructure replacements. Disposable scaffolding versus roads and waterworks.
* Praise for [Inkle](http://www.inklestudios.com).
* Praise for [FailBetter](http://www.failbettergames.com)/[FundBetter](http://www.failbettergames.com/fundbetter/).
* Hybrid models are possible if infrastructure is the end goal.
* Baldur's problem with [Readium](http://readium.org).
* What does this dichotomy mean for publishers?
* What is a publisher in print? What is a publisher in digital?
* End-to-end integration is very hard to pull off in digital. Choose a focus: author or audiences.
* Audience aggregators versus production aggregators.
* Publishers act as if authors were completely fungible. Foundation labour in publishing is brittle.
* Using [Unbound](https://unbound.co.uk) as a case study: a social capital converter.
* Trade publishers don't have that clarity yet.
* The two potential models.
* Authors, unfortunately, need social capital.
* [The obligatory Craig Mod reference](http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/).
* Create a clear value proposition for either the author or the audience.
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com) as premium LiveJournal communities. Why it is big and getting bigger. Baldur forgot [Erika Moen's](https://twitter.com/ErikaMoen) name despite [reading her work](http://www.ohjoysextoy.com) for [over a decade](http://www.darcomic.com/2004/01/01/whatthefuck/).
* Patreon as a pure audience aggregator that's agnostic about the content format. Disconnecting the business model from the production model results in creative freedom.
* Bolting book retail model on web artefacts.
* Subscription requires a clear and concrete value proposition.
* How do you get to the point where you're covering your costs?
* Patreon only works if you do like Dave Sim did with [Cerebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark): deliver on your promises, consistently and reliably. (All of Dave Sim's other weirdnesses are decidedly optional.)
* The 'Print is Great' worldview hinders all digital efforts.
* How Baldur could fund the purchase of the cheapest iPad Mini.
* 'Toxic' is relative.
* Amazon's asymmetric bet with the Kindle.
* Print is viable in the long term, just not interesting to Baldur.

Warning! Contains ums, aws, and wobbly arguments.
