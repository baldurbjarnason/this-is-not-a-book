Tom was in Montr√©al the other day for a conference and we recorded a podcast episode reviewing what has happened in the two years that have passed since the last episode.

In this episode we talk about, amongst other things: 

* How fine arts and literary fiction projects are generally more successful than software projects as they are more likely to achieve what they aimed to achieve than software.
* The industry cites 'commercial viability' without actually looking at what's commercially viable.
* The gap between what people clearly want and what is being provided.
* How the publishing industry should be doing more experimentation that's explicitly targeted at the mainstream.
* How next to nothing has changed in two years.
* Value and business models.
* People are hungry for new and interesting things.

Warning! Iffy acoustics and we are well out of practice at this podcast thing.
