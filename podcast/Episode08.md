Some thoughts on where to go from wherever you are. Most of us aren't in the position of even *trying* to make the same mistakes Touchpress did. What approaches can the rest of us take towards making new things? Without taking on VC-funding, that is.

* As always start with the community around you. If you can find 100 people who share your interests even before you start, so much the better.
* Start small, start cheap. Build up your costs and capabilities over time. 
* Read Craig Mod's [Post-Artefact Books and Publishing](http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/)
* Stick to a genre or theme. Define your audience by defining your work.
* Make the community a part of your career.
* Don't start with a bang. Build up to big things with a series of small. Don't start with the epics. The body of work should be epic, not individual works. Bootstrap.
* Put work out with some frequency.
* We also go off topic a bit.
* If you want to do technical things you need technical skills (no way around it, really).
* If you want to do creative things you need creative skills (no way around that either).
* If you want to do something that's both technical and creative, you need to understand both (sorry, not sorry).
* HTML as the lingua franca of technical production.
* Iterate in public.
* The currency of digital is attention.
* People need to use Youtube more.
* We talk a lot about Mark Z. Danielewski and his body of work. The value of having an insane fanbase.
