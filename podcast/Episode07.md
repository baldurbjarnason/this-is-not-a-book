Some thoughts prompted by [Touchpress's pivot](http://www.thebookseller.com/news/touchpress-pivots-business-selling-education-apps-316108).

* Touchpress, who?
* The core problem with the app stores.
* The difference between bookstores and digital markets.
* The importance in digital of having a specific worldview.
* The big advantage that ebooks have over apps.
* Who makes money in the app store?
* A lot of talk about [The Silent History](http://www.thesilenthistory.com).
* In praise of low budget projects, made by small groups of people.
* McSweeney’s.
* [The Pickle Index](http://www.thepickleindex.com).
* On games not being the only future of digital storytelling. (*A* future, absolutely, just not the only one.)
* If you copy too much from games, you end up competing with games, and they're generally much better at it.
* High production value videos are soooooo expensive.
* Pick a genre and stick to it.
* Baldur goes on a rant on publishing industry contracts.
* On not confusing detail with quality.
