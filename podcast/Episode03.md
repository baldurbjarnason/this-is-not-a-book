The kitchen talks continue. This time we (Baldur and Tom) talk about: the differing qualities of digital and print; how they can complement each other; how they suffer if you ignore their strengths and weaknesses; how the novel will be fine but the rest should worry. Some things are good. Some things are bad. The whole is interesting.

May contain swearing.
