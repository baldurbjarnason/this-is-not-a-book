In this one we cover the following thingamajigs:

* Baldur talks about what it feels like to anticipate that the mainstream will coincide with your interests but then watching it go into a different direction. Three different directions, to be specific.
* Craig Mod's [article](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/why-have-digital-books-stopped-evolving/). (And the [coda he posted on his website](http://craigmod.com/sputnik/as_we_may_read/), which you should also read.)
* Fahrenheit Press's audience engagement.
* [Xcode playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/Playground_Help/Chapters/AboutPlaygrounds.html).
* Involving the reader. Breaking out of the insular.
* Any involvement of the reader is experimental.
* Singing the praises of [Sam Missingham](https://twitter.com/samatlounge).
* The value of making deliberate mistakes. Mistakes, not failure.
* Singing the praises of [Inkle Studios](http://www.inklestudios.com).
* The big risk that publishers are taking.

May contain swearing.
